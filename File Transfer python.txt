This is a fairly well-known method to share files over devices in general, but not something that everyone knows. No extra software is required except Python 3 (In Mac, Python 2.7 is pre-installed so no prerequisites there). This method is faster than using USB drives and uses no data over the internet.

You must click 'Like' before you can see the hidden data contained here

Python 3 Method(Windows):
Navigate to the directory containing the files you want to share.
Hold Shift and press Right-click
Select "Open Powershell Window here"
now type:
Python: 
python -m http.server 1234
Open another instance of Powershell and type:
Code: 
ipconfig
Note the IPv4 address of your adapter; it would be something like 192.168.50.1
Now, open another system on which you want to receive the files. (It should be connected to same Wi-Fi or LAN network)
Open up any browser and type:
your_ip:1234
for example, if your IP was "192.168.50.1", then you have to open 192.168.50.1:1234 in the browser
it will give you access to that particular folder.
You may use IDM or JDownloader there to download the files

Python 2.7 Method(Mac)
Open up the terminal
Navigate to the directory which contains the files to be shared
now type:
Python: 
python -m simpleHTTPserver 1234
Open another instance of terminal and type:
Code: 
ifconfig
Note the IPv4 address of your adapter; it would be something like 192.168.50.1
Now, open another system on which you want to receive the files. (It should be connected to same Wi-Fi or LAN network)
Open up any browser and type:
your_ip:1234
for example, if your IP was "192.168.50.1", then you have to open 192.168.50.1:1234 in the browser
it will give you access to that particular folder.
You may use IDM or JDownloader there to download the files


Note1: This works in command prompt too
Note2: IDM or JDownloader can download those files
Note3: Feel free to ask if there is any confusion. My first post here so things can go wrong. I will try to answer queries in my non-working and non-sleeping time.
